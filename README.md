# Building-Level-Heat-Demand-Mapping-for-Automated-DH-Assessments-USA
These are the building-level heat demand mapping outcomes for Moses Lake, WA, McCall, ID, and Helena, MT. The methods of development are scheduled for public availability.
Mapping methods found in that work should be easily replicable in other states and locales for district heat planning purposes. 

Note: This method is for properties without tax or revenue exemptions. 

District heating will play a significant role in building stock decarbonization as the country and the world moves on with a necessary energy transition, away from fossil fuel combustion.
